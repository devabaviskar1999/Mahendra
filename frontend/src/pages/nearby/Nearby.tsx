            years ago. That’s the magic of the Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra,
            built by Buddhist monks without any machines, just using hammers and
            chisels. Inside, there are breathtaking murals showing the life of
            Buddha, like one where he gives up his royal life to find peace, and
            another that tells how he once saved a dove from a cruel king.
            There’s even a cave with a giant Buddha statue that feels so
            peaceful, it’s like time stops around you. It’s truly fascinating
            how ancient humans turned rock into art, temples, and stories that
            still speak to us today."
